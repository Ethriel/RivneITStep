        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>

        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><mark>ax + b = 0</mark></p>

        <p>where <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> are real numbers and <span>x</span> is a variable. This form is
            sometimes called the
            standard
            form of a linear
            equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not
            be an <span>x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span>x</span> there.</p>

        <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>

        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><mark>x<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</mark></p>

        where <span>a</span>, <span>b</span>, <span>c</span> are known values and <span>x</span> is the variable or
        unknown (we don't know it
        yet). Also, <span>a</span> can't be 0.

        <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>

        <p><span>&#960;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span>r</span>) squared:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><mark>A = &#960; &#215; r<sup>2</sup></mark></p>

        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span>D</span>):</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><mark>A = (&#960; / 4) &#215; D <sup>2</sup></mark></p>

        <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span>C</span>):</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><mark>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215; &#960;</mark></p>

        <h3>Intersection</h3>

        <p>The intersection of two sets <span>A</span> and <span>B</span>, denoted by A &#8745; B, is the set of all
            objects that are members of both the
            sets A and B. In symbols,</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><mark>A &#8745; B = { x : x &#8712; A and x &#8712; B }</mark></p>

        <p>That is, <span>x</span> is an element of the intersection A &#8745;B if and only if <span>x</span> is both an
            element of <span>A</span> and an element of
            <span>B</span>.</p>
